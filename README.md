# What is Rapid Prototyping?
Rapid prototyping in video game development refers to the process of quickly creating playable versions of game concepts or features to test their feasibility, gameplay mechanics, and overall fun factor. It's a crucial phase in game development that allows designers and developers to iterate on ideas rapidly, gather feedback, and refine the game before investing significant time and resources into full production.
